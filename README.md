## What is Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** is a collection of documentation and specialized agents that supercharge AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and Aider.

Think of it as a **"knowledge pack"** — when you add Agent Skills to your project, your AI assistant gains access to thousands of lines of curated technical expertise about specific frameworks and technologies. This means better code suggestions, fewer mistakes, and more helpful responses.

---

## Why use it?

| Without Agent Skills | With Agent Skills |
|---|---|
| Generic "how to write a Python function" | Framework-specific "how to write an Odoo 18 model with proper ORM patterns" |
| AI guesses at framework conventions | AI follows documented best practices |
| You re-explain project context every session | Context lives in the repo — AI reads it automatically |
| Subtle bugs from outdated or mixed-version advice | Version-pinned guides (Odoo 17 / 18 / 19) |
| Generic security suggestions | Enforced security rules for enterprise applications |

---

## Quick Start

Get started in 30 seconds with NPX:

```bash
# Add Agent Skills to your current project
npx skills add unclecatvn/agent-skills
```

That's it! Your AI assistant will now have access to all the skills in this repository.

## Real-World Example

**Prompt:**
> *"Add a computed field `total_with_tax` to `sale.order` that sums line totals plus VAT."*

<table>
<tr>
<th>Without Agent Skills</th>
<th>With Agent Skills</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

```python
# Generic guess — may use
# wrong API for your Odoo version
total_with_tax = fields.Float(
    compute='_compute_total'
)

def _compute_total(self):
    for rec in self:
        rec.total_with_tax = sum(
            l.price * 1.1
            for l in rec.order_line
        )
```

</td>
<td valign="top">

```python
# Odoo conventions (17 / 18 / 19):
# Monetary + @api.depends + store
total_with_tax = fields.Monetary(
    compute='_compute_total_with_tax',
    store=True,
    currency_field='currency_id',
)

@api.depends('order_line.price_total')
def _compute_total_with_tax(self):
    for order in self:
        order.total_with_tax = sum(
            order.order_line.mapped('price_total')
        )
```

### Agents — Autonomous Reviewers

Specialized agents that act as senior technical leads:

| Agent | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **[Odoo Code Review](agents/odoo-code-review/SKILL.md)** | Reviews Odoo code with scoring (1–10) and structured feedback |
| **[Odoo Code Tracer](agents/odoo-code-tracer/SKILL.md)** | Traces execution flow from an entry point through the call graph |
| **[Planner](agents/planner.md)** | Breaks down complex features into actionable implementation steps |

### Rules — Coding Standards

Enforced patterns for consistent, secure code:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[Coding Style](rules/coding-style.md)** | Best practices for naming, imports, and code structure |
| **[Security](rules/security.md)** | Security patterns for enterprise applications |
