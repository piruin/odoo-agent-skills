# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.10]

### Release Description
Made the Odoo agents version-aware (17 / 18 / 19) so they load the right reference pack automatically instead of always citing Odoo 18 APIs. Also fixed broken guide paths in `odoo-code-review`.

### Added
- `skills/odoo-17.0/references/api-highlights.md`, `skills/odoo-18.0/references/api-highlights.md`, `skills/odoo-19.0/references/api-highlights.md` — per-version, version-distinguishing rulesets (list tag, attrs syntax, aggregator parameter, optional `_name` in v19, etc.) that the agents load alongside the general checklist.
- Target-version resolution step in `agents/odoo-code-review/SKILL.md` and `agents/odoo-code-tracer/SKILL.md` with a four-level fallback: explicit argument → project config (`.odoo-version`, `.claude/odoo.json`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`) → `__manifest__.py` heuristic → default to latest (`19.0`).
- README section "Targeting an Odoo version" documenting the resolution order.

### Changed
- `agents/odoo-code-review/SKILL.md` rewritten version-neutral. Every guide reference now uses `skills/odoo-${ODOO_VERSION}/references/odoo-${ODOO_MAJOR}-*-guide.md` placeholders resolved at invocation time.
- `agents/odoo-code-tracer/SKILL.md` generalised: agent description, "Specific Patterns" section, and "Related Skills" no longer hard-code Odoo 18.
- `README.md` Odoo example comment generalised from "Odoo 18 conventions" to "Odoo conventions (17 / 18 / 19)" since the pattern is identical across supported versions.

### Fixed
- `agents/odoo-code-review/SKILL.md` guide paths: `skills/odoo/18.0/` → `skills/odoo-18.0/`, and `dev/odoo-18-*-guide.md` → `references/odoo-18-*-guide.md` (the original paths did not exist in the repo).

### Notes
- Supported version matrix: **17.0, 18.0, 19.0**. Older versions are out of scope.
- Addresses #7.

## [1.0.9]

### Release Description
Added the `odoo-17.0` skill pack: 18 reference guides plus `SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, all verified against the Odoo 17 source tree.

### Added
- New skill pack `skills/odoo-17.0/` covering Odoo 17 development:
  - `SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` (master index, Claude Code guide, IDE setup)
  - 18 reference guides in `skills/odoo-17.0/references/`: actions, controller, data, decorator, development, field, manifest, migration, mixins, model, owl, performance, reports, security, testing, transaction, translation, view
- Documented v17-specific conventions that differ from v18/v19:
  - `<tree>` list tag (v18 renamed to `<list>`)
  - Direct expression attributes `invisible="state == 'done'"` — v17 removed the legacy `attrs="{...}"` and `states="..."` forms (the view validator raises `ValidationError` since 17.0)
  - `group_operator=` field aggregation (v18 renamed to `aggregator=`)
  - `_sql_constraints` tuple form (v19 introduced `models.Constraint`)
  - `index=True` on fields (v19 introduced `models.Index`)
  - `cr.execute()` with plain SQL as the primary pattern (v18 added `env.execute_query_dict()`)
  - `read_group()` as the public API (v18 deprecated it in favor of `_read_group()` / `formatted_read_group()`)
  - Kanban templates still use `t-name="kanban-box"` (v19 renamed to `t-name="card"`)
  - Explicit `<div class="oe_chatter">` with `message_follower_ids` / `activity_ids` / `message_ids` (v18 introduced the `<chatter/>` shortcut)
  - `res.groups.category_id` (v19 introduced `privilege_id`)
  - `@api.private` decorator and `@api.ondelete(at_uninstall=False)` are available in v17
  - JSONB-based field translations (no `ir.translation` rows for model fields since v16)
  - Module hooks `pre_init_hook(env)` / `post_init_hook(env)` / `uninstall_hook(env)` all take `env`
  - Migration script entry `def migrate(cr, installed_version):` in `migrations/17.0.X.Y.Z/`
  - Module version string format `17.0.X.Y.Z`
  - `web.assets_common` was merged into `web.assets_frontend` before v17 shipped
- Example manifests use `'author': 'UncleCat'` and every module skeleton includes `i18n/` with a `.pot` template.

## [1.0.7]

### Release Description
This release standardizes the project release process so GitHub Releases are generated directly from `CHANGELOG.md`, with automated semantic version bump support.

### Added
- Added `bin/release-bump.js` to automate release preparation from `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added npm scripts:
  - `npm run release:bump` to compute and apply the next semantic version.
  - `npm run release:bump:dry` to preview bump type/version without writing files.
- Added root `CHANGELOG.md` as the canonical source for release notes used by CI.

### Changed
- Updated `.github/workflows/github-release.yml` to build release notes from the matching version section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Updated `.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` to create/edit GitHub Releases using `--notes-file` instead of autogenerated notes.
- Release jobs now validate changelog coverage and fail fast if the target version section is missing.
- Updated release flow to support a docs-first process: write notes in-repo, then push once to publish tag and release.

### Build
- Bumped package version to `1.0.7` in `package.json`.
